2. System Description
2.1 Current System:
No centralized platform exists to connect individuals with repair needs to local experts or resources.
Broken items are often discarded due to the difficulty of finding repair services or lacking the necessary skills and tools.
Repair experts and sustainability advocates work independently, limiting collaboration and resource sharing.
This fragmented system contributes to increased waste and missed opportunities for sustainable practices.

       The proposed platform aims to address these challenges with the following features:
Repair Request Matching: Automatically connects users with local repair experts or available resources.
Skill-Sharing and Tutorials: Provides guides, workshops, and live sessions to help users learn repair skills.
Resource Sharing Hub: Facilitates borrowing, renting, or sharing of tools, spare parts, and equipment.
Digital Marketplace: Enables users to sell, trade, or donate repaired and upcycled items.
Real-Time Notifications: Keeps users updated on repair requests, matches, and available resources.
Eco-Impact Tracking: Displays metrics like waste diverted and carbon emissions saved through community efforts.
Secure Transactions: Handles payments, contracts, and formalities securely within the platform.
